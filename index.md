## Welcome to my homepage!

This homepage is just created and I am new to github pages. It looks ugly now I know, but it will be better.


### Introduction
I am Yan Dong. I got my bachelor degree (Automation) from Beijing Institute of Technology (BIT) in 2018, now I am a master's student in Tsinghua University (THU). My research interests are SLAM & event-based cameras. My updated CV can be found [here].

### Project & Research

#### AGV scanner (Finished)
Deleloped a robust and real-time algorithm to localize datamatrix tags on ground. The algorithm runs in rasberry pi 4 with up to 40fps. The scanner prototype is now used in many applications of our partners.

#### Coal mining support 3D reconstrction (In process)
Reconstruct hydraulic pressure supports in mine. Two LiDARs are used for localization and reconstruction.

#### Event-based feature tracking
Proposed a new algorithm using both event-based camera and standard cameras for feature tracking. Source codes will be released soon.
